## Why Monitor Blood Pressure?

Blood pressure monitoring is crucial for:
- **Detect preeclampsia early** - Serious pregnancy condition
- **Track cardiovascular health** - Yours and baby's
- **Adjust medication** if needed
- **Prevent complications** during pregnancy
- **Provide accurate data** to your doctor

## Understanding the Values

### Normal Blood Pressure in Pregnancy
- **Systolic**: 90-120 mmHg (upper number)
- **Diastolic**: 60-80 mmHg (lower number)
- Example of normal reading: 110/70 mmHg

### Values Requiring Attention
- **Systolic ≥ 140** or **Diastolic ≥ 90** - Contact doctor
- **Systolic < 90** or **Diastolic < 60** - Low pressure, discuss with doctor
- **Sudden variations** - Rapid increase or decrease

### Normal Heart Rate
- **At rest**: 60-100 bpm (beats per minute)
- **During pregnancy**: May be slightly higher (up to 100-110 bpm)
- **After exercise**: Higher, but should return to normal

## How to Measure Correctly

### Preparation
- **Rest 5 minutes** before measuring
- **Avoid caffeine** 30 minutes before
- **Empty bladder** before measurement
- **Sit comfortably** with feet on floor

### During Measurement
- **Use appropriate cuff** - Correct size
- **Position arm at heart level**
- **Stay still** - Don't talk during measurement
- **Breathe normally** - Don't hold breath

### Best Practices
- **Same time daily** - Consistency is important
- **Use same arm** - Usually left
- **Measure 2-3 times** - Average if there's difference
- **Record immediately** - Don't rely on memory

## When to Measure

### Daily Routine
- **Morning**: After waking, before medication
- **Evening**: Before bed, after relaxing
- **After rest**: Always in calm state

### Special Situations
- **Before appointments** - To report recent values
- **If feeling unwell** - Dizziness, headache
- **After stress** - To monitor recovery
- **As medically advised** - Recommended frequency
